    <h1>Dear Mom,</h1>
    <h2>Happy Mother’s Day!</h2>
    <p>Words will never be enough to express how much you mean to me. You are my strength, my comfort, and my forever home. Every sacrifice you made, every sleepless night, every warm hug—has shaped the person I am today. Your love has been the silent force behind every success and the healing touch in every failure.</p>

    <p>I often forget to say it, but thank you—for being patient when I was difficult, for believing in me when I didn’t believe in myself, and for loving me without conditions. You’ve given me more than I could ever ask for, and I carry your lessons with me every day.</p>

    <p>You are my hero, my best friend, and my biggest blessing. I love you more than words can ever say.</p>

    <p>With all my heart, <br>Your child</p>
